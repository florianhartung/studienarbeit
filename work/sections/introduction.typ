// Motivation
- Plugin systems are great!
- WASM is great 
#todo[write motivation last]

// Problem statement
- WASM's usecases are very limited -> it is still very new and evolving
- Plugin systems suffer from many issues: Security, interoperability, Portability, (Developer experience?)

== Research question
- Can WebAssembly be _the_ universal technology for building versatile plugin systems?

== Method (structure of this work)
